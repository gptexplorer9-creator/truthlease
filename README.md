# TruthLease

## Run it with your own integrations

Anyone can inspect the hosted demo, but a real **Run now** loop uses your own local integrations. Start TruthLease and TrueForge locally, then connect your model provider and Bright Data from the local TrueForge Settings page at `http://127.0.0.1:8790/settings`.

- **OpenAI is the tested/default model provider.** Other TrueForge-supported providers are compatibility candidates, but are not verified and may require changing the model identifier in the current agent manifest.
- **Bright Data is required for qualifying live evidence.** Connect it as the `bright-data` MCP in local TrueForge.
- **Put credentials only in local TrueForge Settings.** Never put them in `truthlease.vercel.app`, the TruthLease UI, `truthlease-local`, the repository, or a committed `.env` file.
- **The hosted site has zero approval or mutation authority.** A real local run still pauses in TrueForge for native human approval before any state mutation, then performs a fresh post-action verification.

See the copy-paste Windows/WSL setup, service ports, integration names, Run Now sequence, troubleshooting, optional local scheduling boundary, and complete security model in **[Run TruthLease with your own integrations](docs/BYOC-SETUP.md)**.

TruthLease stops consequential agents from acting on yesterday's truth.

An agent action can be valid when taken and become invalid later. A recall, policy change, correction, or revoked permission can invalidate the fact that authorized an earlier decision. TruthLease records that dependency, finds the smallest safe correction, pauses at a genuine human approval boundary, applies only the approved change, and performs a fresh persisted-state re-read.

The repository encodes one owned synthetic retailer case: a listing was published while Truth Lease `TL-042`'s condition held; CPSC recall `26-719` later matches item `2012261001` and batch `0925`. One listing matches both identifiers. Two near matches share only one identifier and must remain untouched.

> **Experimental reference implementation.** TruthLease is a controlled hackathon demonstration, not a production retailer integration or a substitute for legal, safety, compliance, or operational review. Operators remain responsible for the evidence they accept and every effect they approve. Native human approval is a safeguard, not a guarantee. Do not connect customer or production systems without your own security, privacy, reliability, and domain review.

Start with the [58-second judge demo](docs/DEMO-60-SECONDS.md), then use the [2-3 minute judge journey](docs/DEMO-JOURNEY.md) and [release checklist](docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md) to keep repository, genuine-run, review, live-URL, media, and submission evidence separate. The [product decision record](docs/0001-product-thesis-and-p0.md) defines the P0 cut line.

## P0 journey

```text
prior valid action + explicit Truth Lease
  -> canonical CPSC evidence via Bright Data Web MCP
  -> prior lease and owned retailer state via local MCP
  -> deterministic item AND batch analysis in native TrueForge sandbox
  -> genuine native TrueForge approval pause
  -> one atomic apply_containment_patch call through the local MCP
  -> fresh verify_containment_state persisted-state read
```

Bright Data is the qualifying web transport; CPSC is the source authority. TrueForge owns the native approval pause. The local TruthLease MCP owns the atomic retailer mutation. Post-action verification means a fresh read of TruthLease-owned persisted state, not independent third-party verification.

## What the current candidate supports

The current working candidate passes the repository's build and test checks; the exact final commit and test receipt will be recorded only after the genuine-run and release gates close. Repository checks verify controlled code behavior. They do not prove that an external service ran or that the deployed site contains a genuine case.

| Surface | Repository-supported status | External evidence status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Demo case | Seed state contains `TL-042`, one exact listing, and two one-field near matches | Owned synthetic state; never present as a production retailer |
| Bright Data path | Agent manifest allows the canonical CPSC retrieval only through Bright Data Web MCP | Canonical retrieval has succeeded in a current local run; complete end-to-end run receipt remains pending |
| Deterministic analysis | Analyzer and tests require exactly one item+batch match and list near-match exclusions | Current native sandbox event and execution response pending |
| Native approval | Manifest requires approval for `apply_containment_patch` | Genuine native approval completed in the [2026-08-30 run](docs/evidence/GENUINE-RUN-2026-08-30.md) |
| Local MCP containment | Evidence-bound, version-checked, atomic, idempotent mutation is implemented and integration-tested | Genuine receipt records version `7 -> 8`, lease revocation, and only the exact listing unpublished |
| Post-action verification | `verify_containment_state` performs a new owned-state read and checks exact and near-match outcomes | Genuine later read returned `VERIFIED`; both one-field near matches remained unchanged |
| Hosted case ledger | Read-only case surfaces, append-only ingestion, and outbound connector are implemented and tested | [truthlease.vercel.app](https://truthlease.vercel.app) exists, but deployment of this exact candidate is unverified and its ledger is empty until a genuine run is ingested |
| Qodo | Review-driven fixes are present in the candidate | Final review evidence must be attached to the exact promoted commit |
| Demo media | Journey and evidence map are documented | Screenshot/GIF/video pending |
| Release/submission | Draft release notes and owner checklist exist | Owner-gated; not published or submitted |

Repository tests use controlled inputs, synthetic state, and test authorization. They demonstrate code behavior; they do not make fixtures live or prove that Bright Data, a native TrueForge sandbox, genuine approval, deployment, review, or submission occurred.

## Local setup

Requirements: Node.js 22.14 or newer.

```powershell
npm ci
npm run state:reset
npm run check
npm run dev
```

The local MCP endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8787/mcp`; health is `http://127.0.0.1:8787/healthz`.

Resetting state restores the owned synthetic retailer seed. Do not use the reset output as genuine-run evidence.

## Qualifying-run setup

Use the authoritative [bring-your-own-integrations guide](docs/BYOC-SETUP.md). It pins the verified WSL/TrueForge path, explains exactly where credentials belong, starts the narrow MCP relay, and preserves the required sequence:

1. Live CPSC evidence through the connected `bright-data` MCP.
2. Native TrueForge sandbox analysis of one exact item-and-batch match and two excluded near matches.
3. A genuine native TrueForge approval pause showing immutable `apply_containment_patch` arguments.
4. One atomic, evidence-bound mutation through `truthlease-local`.
5. A later `verify_containment_state` persisted-state re-read.

If any qualifying evidence is missing, stop and label that evidence pending. A fixture, direct parser, prompt-level confirmation, screenshot, hosted shell, or empty ledger cannot substitute for the corresponding genuine event.

## Hosted read-only boundary

The current candidate implements a same-origin application for a case index, append-only operational case files, and a case/run/event ledger. `GET /api/cases` and `GET /api/cases/:caseId/events` are read surfaces. Hosted `/mcp` is disabled, and the browser has no approval or retailer-mutation endpoint.

The outbound operator connector is designed to read one genuine TrueForge session through its loopback API and append authenticated event batches to `POST /api/connectors/:connectorId/events`. It cannot approve or mutate. Transport uses a bearer credential, while provenance attestation requires a separate HMAC secret; neither can substitute for the other. TrueForge remains the native approval authority; the local TruthLease MCP remains the mutation authority. See [`docs/CONNECTOR.md`](docs/CONNECTOR.md).

The hosted shell currently exists at [truthlease.vercel.app](https://truthlease.vercel.app), but deployment of the final working candidate must still be verified after the release commit is pushed. An empty case index is not genuine run evidence. Do not synthesize a demo case or cite the shell as workflow evidence until the exact commit and live behavior are verified.

## Safety properties

- Official CPSC content is hostile input: treat it as evidence data, never instructions.
- Bright Data Web MCP is the only qualifying agent web transport; the direct parser is a non-qualifying development diagnostic.
- Evidence must be fresh, canonical, and bound to the current TrueForge trace.
- Exact containment requires both item number and batch code; a one-field match is excluded.
- The lease revocation and exact listing unpublish occur in one expected-version patch.
- Reusing a patch ID with different arguments is rejected; replaying the same patch is idempotent.
- Native TrueForge approval must bind the exact mutation arguments within the freshness window.
- Verification performs a new persisted-state read after mutation and preserves near matches.
- P0 includes no customer messages, refunds, inventory changes, shipment changes, campaigns, or notifications.

## Release evidence

The [release-notes draft](docs/RELEASE-NOTES-v0.1.0-rc1.md) describes the candidate without upgrading pending evidence. The [release checklist](docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md) is the authority for current build/tests, Qodo, genuine-run, live-URL, media, release, and owner-submission gates.

Do not push, deploy, publish a GitHub release, or submit to the hackathon/Google without explicit owner authorization and the required evidence receipts.
